Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love is takin' you
higher
Ridin' on the razor's edge
Fightin' up you're feelin' the
heat of power
In your limbs
Lookin' always straight ahead
Callin' up your strength
and no surrender
Dive and swim
Shinin' in the end, so wild
Go reachin' up for glory lights
So high
Burning' in the sky
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love is takin' you
higher
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love can lead you on!
Walkin' on the fireblade
Just remember you're like a
freedom rider
Stay alive
Lookin' always straight ahead
Callin' up your strength
and no surrender
Dive and swim
Shinin' in the end, so wild
Go reachin' up for glory lights
So high
Burning' in the sky
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love is takin' you
higher
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love can lead you on!
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love is takin' you
higher
Ridin' on the razor's edge
Fightin' up you're feelin' the
heat of power
Lookin' always straight ahead
Callin' up your strength
and no surrender
Dive and swim
Shinin' in the end, so wild
Go reachin' up for glory lights
So high
Burning' in the sky
In the fire of victory
Love is takin' you higher
Ride, in the fire of victory
And shine, love can lead you on!
